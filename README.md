# News-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
News Classification based on AG News dataset using four ML algorithms. 
## Abstract
With the expanding digital world and text content being generated every millisecond, text classification is a growing research area with contributions from researchers worldwide. News articles come in various contexts and to connect these articles to the right audience, they need to be classified. Through this work, we intend to perform a comparative analysis of four supervised machine learning algorithmsâ€”naive Bayes, SVM, random forest, and logistic regression, with three different natural language processing techniques for feature extraction: bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word2vec, to build a news classifier that classifies news articles into their respective categories using just the headlines and short descriptions without having to read through the entire article. For news classification, word2vec feature extraction and logistic regression machine learning model achieved the best performance and efficiency.
## Content
Code file contains the train and test datasets derived from AG news data. Three feature extraction methods, bag of words, tfidf, and Word2Vec, are demonstrated in the seperated notebooks.
